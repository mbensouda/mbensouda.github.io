## Hello, World!

I obtained a PhD in Statistical Physics and Bayesian Inference, applied to Immunology, in September 2022. This was under the supervision of Aleksandra Walczak and Thierry Mora at Ecole Normale Superieure, Paris. During my PhD, I developed several tools for deciphering the dynamics of the T-cell immune repertoire. These tools utilize statistical physics models to disentangle technical and biological noise in highly complex RepSeq data. Since December 2022, I have been working as a Computational Scientist at Altos Labs, focusing on three main areas: quantifying immunogenicity to senescence peptides; leading and guiding a major project in benchmarking, and developing metrics to evaluate longitudinal scRNA-seq datasets. This project involves ML-based analysis methods for reprogramming experiments and developing pipelines to extract candidate gene signatures. Additionally, I am developing a method to quantify cell state transitions in tissues using MERFISH data and deep learning representations.
