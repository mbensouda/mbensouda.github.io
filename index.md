### Research

I am a deeply committed researcher in AI for biology, dedicated to bridging fundamental research with practical applications in biotechnology. Throughout my career, I have placed great emphasis on **first understanding the data deeply**, investing countless hours in deciphering the hidden noise in sequencing to extract subtle yet significant signals. In the realm of biological data, I prioritize spending time to thoroughly comprehend the system described by the data and the processes of its generation. This allows me to accurately identify different noise sources, detect patterns, and consider more sophisticated models that are informed by the data itself. Such models are crucial for probing biological systems, identifying key biomarkers, or predicting phenomena that would otherwise be resource-intensive and time-consuming to explore experimentally.

I am particularly drawn to challenging projects that require extensive time and iterative refinement to achieve meaningful results. My approach is team-oriented, hands-on, focused on problem-solving, and driven by outcomes. I value critical thinking and maintain a positive attitude in all my endeavors.

I am a staunch advocate for open-source science, collaboration, and mentoring the next generation of students to inspire them toward ambitious and creative careers.

Biological and medical data present profound complexities. I am committed to exploring and mastering multiple modalities to forge connections between them and develop interpretable, interoperable, and robust machine learning algorithms for complex biological dataâ€”my favorites being Repertoire Sequencing for the adaptive immune system, single-cell multi-omics, spatial transcriptomics, and clinical data.

In my ongoing educational journey, I continually teach myself:

- biology
- software development and engineering frameworks for model development
- statistics and data science best practices
- new methods in deep learning, focusing on foundational models using the Hugging Face platform and developing some architectures from scratch
- technologies linking AI with the biotech and medtech ecosystems


To validate and reinforce the knowledge I acquire, I share blog posts on this website aimed at democratizing science related to the **adaptive immune repertoire**, **cellular reprogramming** and **partial reprogramming**, the challenges of developing ML models for scRNAseq analysis (including **dimensionality reduction** and **trajectory inference** analysis), and the complexities of using multiple data modalities to better understand highly complex biological systems, either through specific models or by fine-tuning already developed foundational models.

You can find descriptions of my research projects [here](publications.md), along with associated publications.


### In the News
Here is an interview about my motivations from some years ago [in French](https://qbio.ens.psl.eu/newsroom/de-la-physique-la-biologie-des-statistiques-la-vulgarisation-scientifique).

### Hobbies
I am not only a researcher (!) and curiosity is my main default. I love spending time exploring new cultures, new languages, new life-styles, new hobbies to make the most of my life.
